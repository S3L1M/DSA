# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in various programming languages. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about data structures and algorithms or an experienced developer brushing up on your skills, this repository provides a valuable resource.

## Algorithms and Implementations

### 1. Sorted List (Java)

- **Description**: A Java implementation of a sorted list data structure. This data structure maintains elements in ascending order.
- **Features**:
  - Efficient insertion and retrieval.
  - Support for accessing the least and greatest elements.
  - Searching and indexing capabilities.
  - Middle element optimization for faster search and insert operations.
- **Code**: [Sorted List Java](Sorted%20list)

### 2. Frequency Analysis (Java)

- **Description**: Java code for frequency analysis of words in a given text. This code calculates the frequency of each word and provides insights into word occurrences.
- **Features**:
  - Tokenization and frequency calculation.
  - Input from a text file.
  - Analysis and reporting of word frequencies.
- **Code**: [Frequency Analysis Java](Frequency%20analysis)

### 3. Page Ranking (Python)

- **Description**: Python implementation of a page ranking algorithm inspired by web search engines. This code ranks a list of websites based on various factors.
- **Features**:
  - Web scraping to extract data from websites.
  - Ranking based on keywords, page updates, and more.
  - Output ranking of websites.
- **Code**: [Page Ranking Python](Page%20Ranking)

### 4. Uppercase Keywords (C++)

- **Description**: C++ program for processing a set of sentences and converting specific keywords to uppercase.
- **Features**:
  - Input from a file with sentences and keywords.
  - Conversion of keywords to uppercase.
  - Output of modified sentences.
- **Code**: [Uppercase Keywords](Uppercase%20keywords)

### 5. Bubble Sort (C)

- **Description**: C code for an in-place bubble sort algorithm.
- **Features**:
  - Sorting an array of integers in ascending order.
  - Efficient swapping of elements.
- **Code**: [Bubble Sort](Bubble%20sort)
